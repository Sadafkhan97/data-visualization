## Data Visualization Project
# Overview
This repository contains a collection of data visualization projects that showcase different techniques for visualizing data. These visualizations are created using Python, along with popular libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The goal of these projects is to make complex data easier to understand through intuitive visual representations.

# Features
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Ensures the data is ready for effective visualization.
Matplotlib Visualizations: Bar charts, line plots, histograms, pie charts, etc.
Seaborn Visualizations: Heatmaps, correlation plots, and more statistical visualizations.
Plotly Visualizations: Interactive visualizations like scatter plots, 3D plots, and more.
Customized Styles: Adjusting themes, color palettes, labels, and legends for better readability.
Dashboard Creation: Building dynamic, interactive dashboards for real-time data representation.

# Libraries Used
The project relies on several well-known Python libraries for data visualization:
Matplotlib: A foundational 2D plotting library in Python.
Seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib, offering a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
Plotly: A library for creating interactive visualizations.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and cleaning.
NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling.
Tableau: (Optional) Some visualizations may be created using Tableau for dynamic dashboarding.
